WWW-JSONAPI

WWW::JSONAPI is a thin and hopelessly inadequate wrapper around LWP just to abstract out the JSON-handling aspects of dealing with a remote API for my WWW::KeePassRest module while requiring as few dependencies as possible. As such, it's not ready for prime time but has nevertheless been an instructive endeavor.

If you're wanting to write a client for a JSON API, you probably want WWW::JSON at the moment.  Later, though, maybe I'll build something useful out of this module.
